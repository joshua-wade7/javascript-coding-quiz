We are setting up a coding quiz

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


Variables (add to them as you think of them)

Process:

When we click the start button, we want the quiz to begin.  
1. There needs to be a page shift from the load page to the first quiz question
2. The timer needs to begin counting down from (80 seconds?)
3. The questions needs to be displayed in the h1 element of the start-quiz section element
4. There needs to be 4 multiple choice answers given to the user to select from (event listeners need to be on those buttons AND the answer options need to be displayed on the buttons)
5. when the user clicks on their answer, the page should shift to the next question and display beneath them "right" or "wrong"
- this process should continue for 5 questions and then terminate.

IF the user selects the wrong answer, the time remaining will be decreased.
IF the time reaches 0 before the final question is answered, the user should be taken to the end game screen
(end game screen)
